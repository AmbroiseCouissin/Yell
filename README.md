# Yell
Yell is a messenger based on standard acoustic mechanism (Sound intensity level, Inverse-Square Law...) applied upon distances between users (Latitude & Longitude, Haversine...).

There are no chatrooms, and no secrets. Just noise filtering.

Every Yell users have a voice power level (in Watt) that can be used to Yell (or whisper) things around.
The 'louder' you Yell, the more intensity (in dB) the message carries, the more distant from your position the message gets carried to, the more your voice power level gets depleted.
The voice power level recovers gradually with time so that other messages can be sent.

You can adjust the sensitivity of what you hear based on your current position (latitude & longitude).
